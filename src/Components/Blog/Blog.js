              As you can see, this blog is super new, but I intend to provide
              quality content as often as I possibly can either through these
              blog posts, various articles, and/or our round table discussion,
              "Senpai's Traphouse".

              A little about myself...I've been watching anime since I was about
              six when I saw my first episode of Pokemon. I enjoy almost all
              genres, and I'm willing to try almost any show once at least. You
              won't know you like it if you don't try. I also enjoy sci-fi
              movies, reading (Ender's Game is my all time favorite), and
              anything involving superheroes. I'm pretty terrible at video
              games, but Sonic is my Super Smash character and I almost always
              pick the water starter in Pokemon. (I think knowing these two
              things will tell you a lot about somebody!)
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not perfect. I do not consider myself an expert by any means.
              I am just an anime fan like anyone else. So, if you ever have any
              comments, ideas, suggestions or whatever else, I'm always open to
              hearing it! This is like my passion project and I want everyone
              visiting to get the most out of their experience!
            </p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Your Senpai!</strong>
