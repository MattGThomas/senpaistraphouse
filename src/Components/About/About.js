      <h2>WHAT IS SENPAI'S TRAPHOUSE</h2>
      <p>
        Senpai's Traphouse is a site for fans, run by fans, providing a new,
        fresh take on everyone's favorite shows from a more urban perspective.
        This is about being able to take one of favorite genres and discuss it
        in a way that relates to our own lives and experiences.{" "}

      <p>
        After searching the market for a site dedicated to reviews from a
        average viewers like myself, I couldn't find anything that quite fit the
        bill. There are many large anime blogs out there for anime inspiration,
        reviewing anime from a feminist perspective, or simply offering anime
        lists, but nothing with the voice and perspective I was looking for, so
        I thought, why not try providing that content myself?{" "}
