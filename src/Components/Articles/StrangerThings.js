                  Promised Neverland is a sci-fi, mystery, thriller. Much like
                  Stranger Things, it centers around a group of young children.
                  Their lives are changed forever after realizing the orphanage
                  they live in may not be all it seems.

                  Eleven year olds Emma, Norman and Ray live a seemingly perfect
                  life with their siblings in the Grace Field House Orphanage
                  hoping to one day be adopted into good families. Although it
                  is strange that none of their previous siblings ever reach out
                  to them after leaving, the children imagine it must be because
                  of how great they are doing on the outside. When their younger
                  sibling, Conny, is adopted the children discover that leaving
                  Grace Field is a far more complicated, sinister farewell.

                  Much like Stranger Things, Promised Neverland is rooted
                  closely in strong friendships and familial bonds. Unlike some
                  of this article’s other suggestions, this anime also follows a
                  group of elementary age children as its central characters.
                  There are plenty of shady adults to go around, as well as
                  clever children. As the central character, Emma gives off
                  serious girl power vibes much like Eleven. She is willing to
                  do anything for her peers. An array of terrifying, man eating
                  demons really adds to the Stranger Things aesthetic as the
                  children navigate how to deal with the impending doom that is
                  closing in on them.

                  <br />
                  Promised Neverland is probably the closest anime on this list
                  to Stranger Things, but of course it is still very unique. If
                  you enjoy a good coming of age story this is a good choice.
                  It’s hard enough making life altering decisions as an adult,
                  but as a child, it’s even crazier to navigate—especially when
                  the life and death of your loved ones is on the line:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This show gives you a much needed re-up on monsters and sci-If
                  that makes stranger things great, but it also filled with tons
                  of mystery. There were times when I didn’t know who I could
                  trust, if anyone, and it delivers several solid plot twists
                  along the way. As someone who has not read the manga, I was on
                  the edge of my seat each week.
                  <br />

                  Much like the kids of Hawkins Elementary, Emma, Ray and Norman
                  are all extremely smart, and it’s interesting to see their
                  various plots and plans both succeed and fail. You’ll be
                  rooting for the children the entire way, but not without a
                  little bit of heartbreak and nail biting as well.

                  Twelve year Riko, a young orphan girl, aspires to be a famous
                  cave raider one day, just like her mother “Liza the
                  Annihilator”. She wants to search for artifacts and discover
                  the secrets of The Abyss, a few gaping hole in the middle of
                  Earth filled with both amazing treasure and terrifying
                  monsters. Neither the curse of the abyss, or the fact that her
                  mother journeyed down on a mission and never returned, are
                  going to stop her from her mission.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  She soon meets a young robot boy in the abyss named Reg, who
                  is about as mysterious and exciting as abyss treasure gets. He
                  has no memories, but they form a dee connection regardless.
                  One day, a note reaches the surface, supposedly from Liza,
                  with a secret message that she is waiting for her daughter at
                  the bottoms of the abyss. Despite the danger of potential
                  death, Riko knows she must go down into the abyss and find her
                  mother. So she and Reg set off on a journey that will forever
                  change their lives.

                  Like Promised Neverland and Stranger Things, this anime is
                  also centered around younger children. Of course there is
                  definitely an array of beasts and monsters to be overcome, as
                  well as a number of adult allies and foes to be dealt with
                  along the way. While Riko is a normal human girl, Reg is
                  definitely more an Eleven type character. He comes with a
                  mysterious past, and a limited knowledge of how the real world
                  works. However, he is incredibly loyal, has bad ass powers and
                  is just all around adorable.

                  <br />
                  Made in the Abyss definitely has some very original world
                  building going on. Unlike Stranger Things, it takes place of
                  more of a fantasy type era, but regardless is still a good
                  watch even if you aren’t much into fantasy.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The animation style feels a little different at first—more
                  cartoonish/chibi-ish than your average anime, but it’s not a
                  hard style to get used to. It works well for the story the
                  anime is telling. It’s not hard to fall in love with the
                  characters and their designs after an episode or two.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Although at first the anime might seem childish, it is
                  anything but. There are deep themes of family, loss, loyalty,
                  death and sacrifice that give this anime a much deeper story
                  line than just children going on an adventure. There’s also
                  plenty of action, a little gore, and some scientific
                  experiments on humans that are basically fucking torture.
                  Overall it’s well rounded story.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  While it might feel likes it’s start off slow, once we make it
                  into the abyss, it begins to pick up and around episode nine I
                  started crying like a bitch and basically didn’t stop until
                  the end—so be prepared. This anime is definitely worth the
                  pain.

                  Shinichi Izumi is a normal, seventeen year old, high school
                  boy until one night he is infected by an alien parasyte.
                  Although meant to take over his body through his head and use
                  it as his host, the parasyte fails and burrows into his hand
                  instead, leaving them two separately thinking entities.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Despite originally coming to kill him, Shinichi and his
                  parasyte, Migi, form a strange symbiotic bond, needing one
                  another to survive. Shinichi’s strong sense of morals often
                  collides with Migi’s strong sense of self preservation, but
                  over time, they are forced to see the other’s point of view
                  while constantly fighting for their lives against other, more
                  hostile, parasytes.

                  The main similarity here is definitely the sci-fi horror
                  concept of minors fighting otherworldly monsters. Like Eleven,
                  Shinichi is forced to navigate a world he does not really fit
                  into, protecting those around him with his unique abilities.
                  Much like Stranger Things, there is a lot of mystery, and the
                  concept of parasytes isn’t as much of a secret as you might
                  think. Watching Shinichi figure out just what his place is in
                  everything, and decide what he’s fighting for, is much like
                  watching Eleven find herself in season two of Stranger Things.

                    Why You Should Give It A Chance
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  First of all, if the reason you like Stranger Things is epic,
                  man eating monsters, that’s enough right there. In design, the
                  parasytes can be pretty similar looking to demigorgons.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Parasyte also has a lot of moralistic food for thought. A
                  sci-fi show where your main character has powers is always
                  bound to come with some deep inner turmoil. While Eleven was
                  already struggling when we met her, we are with Shinichi from
                  day one. If you’re into tragic hero origin stories, this is
                  definitely a good choice. One of the most interesting parts is
                  watching how Shinichi and Migi influence each other’s ideals
                  and change throughout the course of the show, until it feels
                  like they are borderline reversed. (Also it’s just fun to
                  watch Shinichi up the hell out of his swag as the anime
                  progresses)

                  Neon Genesis is the story of a futuristic society, where the
                  burden of humanities future is placed upon the shoulders of
                  young, naïve students

                  <br />
                  Neon Genesis tells the story of Shinji Ikari, and several
                  other children, piloting mechs (giant mechanical robots) and
                  being forced to fight off monsters called Angels. It is
                  basically a post apocalyptic anime, where humanity must fight
                  to survive the reemergence of the very monsters that damned
                  them in the first place.
                  <br />
                  <br /> While Shinji struggles to win battles, he must also
                  overcome his intense feelings of anxiety, abandonment and
                  inadequacy in over to save the world from another major
                  disaster. What he doesn’t know, is that the leaders of the
                  organization he works for, are keeping more secrets than he
                  thinks.

                  (Mild Spoilers) Much like Stranger Things, Neon Genesis is
                  definitely a coming of age story. No one has powers, but we do
                  see a group of kids thrust into the thick of action, having to
                  overcome obstacles in an attempt to save their city. There is
                  a lot of growing up going on in Neon Genesis, much like with
                  kids of Hawkins, and at times it can be hard to navigate that
                  while trying to engage in life threatening battles.

                  <br />
                  Much like the secret organization that held Eleven, Neon
                  Genesis also has a secret organization called Nerv that the
                  protagonists father is a part of. Neon Genesis is full of
                  action, but also full of trauma arises kids, troubled adults
                  and plenty of questionable, self-serving secrets that will
                  have you wondering why people continue to mess with things
                  they do not fully understand.

                    Why You Should Give It A Chance:
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  If you’re already into anime, especially Mechs, then Neon
                  Genesis is worth a watch. If not, it might a little harder to
                  get into.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The show starts off strong, with plenty of action and an
                  ensemble of interesting characters of various ages. There is a
                  slow patch in the middle of the anime for a few eps, but when
                  it picks back up again, the remainder of the anime is non
                  stop.
                  <br />
                  <br />I will say, Neon Genesis can be a bit of a hard watch
                  and at times it can be emotionally exhausting. Many of the
                  characters are dealing with serious inner turmoil and deep
                  struggles (tragic backstories left and right—no one is safe).
                  There is a lot of unresolved trauma, especially within the
                  main character, who struggles to understand his purpose and
                  the adults honestly are not much help. His father is legit
                  dead-beat dad of the year.
