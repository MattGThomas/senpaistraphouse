              Orange is an interesting mix of slice of life, sci-fi, romance and
              drama. Much like 13 Reasons Why, it centers around a group of high
              school kids. Their lives are changed forever by the introduction
              of transfer student, Kakeru Naruse.
              <br />
              Synopsis: After a meet up to celebrate the life of their friend,
              Kakeru Naruse, Naho Takamiya decides to write a letter to her
              former self in hopes of reversing the tragic suicide that would
              change the lives of her and her friends.
              <br />
              Similarities: Much like 13 Reasons, Orange deals with the topics
              of teen suicide, budding teenage romance and friendship. Naho
              Takamiya struggles with feelings for Kakeru, as well as how to
              help him when it becomes obvious that something is wrong. She is
              very much the Clay of the series--unsure about growing up and
              unsure how her feelings play into her friendship with Kakeru.
              Orange illustrates how difficult it can be to help someone who is
              trying to come across as if nothing is wrong. Elements of
              depression and guilt round out the deep relationships and
              motivations of this intimate group of friends.
              <br />
              Why You Should Give It A Chance: While Orange definitely has a
              similar subject matter and tone to 13 Reasons. Still, there are a
              few things that set it apart and make it it's own unique
              experience. A sci-fi element sounds strange in an anime so heavily
              focused on depression and mental health. However, I did manage to
              get one of my non-anime watching friends to check it out simply
              based on the idea that it was similar to 13 Reasons and she was
              pleasantly surprised by how much she liked it. (She binge watched
              it in two days)
              <br />
              Orange has a strong theme of guilt and the characters are often
              driven by the idea of what cues they missed and what they could've
              done differently to help their friend. Naho is as skeptical as
              anyone when she receives letters from her "future" self, but she
              soon realizes there might actually be some truth behind the words
              in the letter. The futuristic element adds a whole new layer of
              depth, as the viewer sees not only what has to change in the past,
              but what these characters are giving up in the future to save the
              life of their friend.
              <br />â€‹ The cast of friends and side characters are also an
              incredibly memorable part of this anime. Along with being crazy
              loyal, they don't come across as stock characters who are there
              for only classic comic relief or as the generic best friends. Each
              character has a role to play, and to this day, all I can say is
              that Suwa might just be one of the best anime friends of all time.
              (Don't sleep on the guy with the glasses though) Much like Jeff in
              13 Reasons, Suwa deserved so much better.

              Anohana is only something you should watch if you're prepared to
              cry--like red faced, heaving, ugly cry. It's a painful look at
              what it's like to grow up, grow apart from your friends, and how
              hard it is to handle grief as a child.
              <br />
              Synopsis: A group of childhood friends drift apart after one of
              them dies in a tragic accident. Years later, Jinta Yadomi, the
              leader of the group with a once promising future, has become a
              depressed, withdrawn shell of his former self. In a surprising,
              supernatural twist, the ghost of his old friend, Menma, appears to
              him, asking him to help her grant her wish so that she can move on
              to the afterlife. The problem is, granting the wish requires the
              help of all of their old friends, and not only has Jinta not
              talked to his friends in years, he's the only one who can see
              Menma's ghost at all.
              <br />
              Similarities: Much like 13 Reasons, Anohana deals with the
              aftermath of the death of a friend. Jinta's demeanor will
              definitely give you Clay vibes. His emotions and struggle to
              finally move on from what happened are painfully easy to relate
              to.
              <br />
              Anohana offers a solid cast of characters, not all of whom are
              kind or supportive. Some are rough around the edges, weird, or
              even downright cruel at times. Like everyone who was featured on
              Hannah Baker's tapes, everyone in Anohana has a different way of
              dealing with their grief and some surprising backstories. From
              parents to friends, there is no shortage of character development
              and growth as you watch these people come to terms with a death
              that's been haunting them for years.
              <br />
              Why You Should Give It A Chance: While Anohana doesn't deal with
              suicide, premature death is just as hard regardless. Honestly
              though, this anime left me screwed up and thinking about it for
              several days after I finished it. It has an interesting
              supernatural element to it with Menma's ghost as a main character
              in the anime. Her relationship with Jinta will seem reminiscent of
              Clay and Hannah's, as there is obviously a strong connection
              there.
              <br />
              What sets Anohana apart though, is the sense of closure that comes
              along with watching the series. It's obvious these characters are
              hurting and have been for a while, but it's almost worse watching
              them get over that pain. Anohana offers a raw look into
              depression, unresolved issues, and growing up. There is no
              shortage of emotion in this anime and in just 11 episodes, I found
              myself questioning how I viewed grief and death entirely. If
              you're looking for an emotional roller coaster drama, this is
              definitely one to add to your list.
