              ReLife is a comedy drama that follows Arata Kaizaki, a failing
              adult, as he enters The ReLife program. This program gives him the
              temporary ability to look ten years younger so that he can to redo
              high school and hopefully change his future and perspective on
              life as a whole.
              <br /> <MDBTypography colorText="light-blue">
                Why:
              </MDBTypography>{" "}
              ReLife is both hilarious and emotionally real at times. It deals
              with the ideas of failure, trauma, and the inability to reach your
              full potential in both adulthood, and as a decent person in
              general. <br />
              After taking the pill to change his appearance and re-entering
              high school as a transfer student, Arata sees not only how things
              have changed since he graduated, but how he has changed too. He’s
              always been personable, and he has more experiences than the
              children he’s around, which allows for him to offer them a
              completely different perspective on life. Yet in his own life, he
              is stagnant and lost. <br />
              While the idea of going back to high school sucks for most people,
              even Arata, he has a chance to do some genuine good, and maybe get
              a job out of it in the end. As long as he can keep his secret
              safe, while still managing to do well in the program (and not ruin
              any young lives), he might have a chance to redo his life better
              the second time around. <br />
              ReLife is a good watch for anyone who enjoys slice of life or high
              school drama. Watching Arata is incredibly relatable for any young
              adult, especially one who’s struggled with what step to take next.
              He’s a reluctant hero who’s drive to do good in adversity makes
              you root for him every step of the way.

              What: Just Because is a high school drama that follows Eita Izumi,
              a high school student who moves back to his hometown for his final
              year of high school. He quickly discovers things are
              simultaneously the same and different as he left them. He still
              has a longstanding crush on Mio Natsume, who still has a crush on
              his best friend, Haruto Sōma. <br />
              As Eita reluctantly attempts to help the persistent photography
              student, Ena Komiya, with her photography contest, love triangles
              and college exams make coming back home much more complicated than
              he expected. <br />
              Why: Just Because is a classic slice of life anime that deals with
              the everyday struggles of high school students. There's some
              romance, and of course some comedy, as well as sports anime
              elements thrown in for a little razzle dazzle. There aren’t any
              crazy plot twists or supernatural happenings, but what kept me
              coming back every week was the strong characters and
              relationships. Everything I felt, I felt hard. I think I went
              through the full spectrum of human emotion watching this. I found
              myself truly invested in this story and rooting for these kids
              along the way. At times the show can be frustrating. The main
              character is very aloof, often coming off as if he could care less
              about what's going on, which is untrue. Even still, I enjoyed him.
              He was a good contrast to many of the other, hyper characters with
              strong personalities. While I will forever be butthurt about the
              ending, many people found the anime to be very realistic. Overall,
              this anime really does remind you about the importance of strong
              friendships and how they can withstand the test of time if you
              give them a chance. It’s quite honest in the sense that not
              everyone gets what they want, but they all learn something
              valuable along the way. <br />

              One Season: 26 episodes <br />
              What: This anime follows the story of Haruhi Fujioka, a girl
              attending a ritzy private school on a scholarship. In the first of
              what will turn out to be a series of wild antics, she breaks a
              ridiculously expensive vase in what she thinks is a random music
              room. Unable to pay for the vase, the occupants of that room
              decide she can pay back its value by working in their “host club”,
              entertaining the school’s female population. The only problem is,
              unlike the other members, Haruhi is not a boy. She simply looks
              like one. However, she does seem to have a real talent for
              entertaining girls though. <br />
              Why: Host Club is easily one of the funniest animes I’ve ever
              watched. At times it’s downright campy in its humor, but still
              incredibly entertaining. It features a range of over the top
              characters, but still manages to stay grounded with a few more
              serious elements, feelings and backstories. It's hard not to find
              yourself loving every character for one reason or another, though
              I do have my favorites (I'm a sucker for anyone dubbed by Greg
              Ayres). There’s romance, a touch of mild drama, and a ton of humor
              to round out this anime and make it a fun, easy watch. <br />
              If you've ever heard of Host Club, it's popularity basically
              speaks for itself. It's the kind of anime you can watch more than
              once and never get tired of it.

              One Season: 24 episodes <br />
              What: Golden Time follows Tada Banri, a college freshman trying to
              navigate college after a recent accident leaves him with no
              memories of his past. Along the way he discovers both friendship
              and love, while learning more about he is, and who he was, in the
              process. <br />
              Why: At first, Golden Time presents itself as your classic slice
              of life, romantic comedy, but it soon reveals itself to be much
              more than that. It is an emotional roller coaster that, at times,
              can be downright heartbreaking (I may or may not have cried). Yet
              it still manages to come off fun and make the viewer laugh. It has
              its own range of twists and turns, as you watch Banri learn more
              about his past.
              <br />
              What makes it interesting is, unlike most people, Banri isn’t
              fighting to go back to who he was before his accident. His story
              isn’t driven by a desire to be his old self again. Instead he
              attempts to move forward and have new experiences as a new Banri,
              even when his past forces its way to the forefront of his life.
              It’s interesting to see this story line play out different from
              the norm. You find yourself torn between rooting for both the old
              and the new Banri. <br />
              The supporting cast rounds out this anime well. They have their
              own unique story lines that are hilarious and compelling in their
              own right. Golden Time puts a unique spin on college life and how
              hard it can be to find yourself as a young adult.
